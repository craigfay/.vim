# Managing Plugins

Since version 8, Vim will natively auto-load plugins in directories matching `~/.vim/pack/*/start/`. This makes it convenient to manage plugins using git submodules instead of a package manager like [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) or [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).


# How To Add Plugins

```
git submodule add <git-address> ./pack/plugins/start/<plugin-name>`
```


# How To Update Plugins

```
git submodule update --remote --merge
git commit
```

# How To Remove Plugins

```
git submodule deinit ./pack/plugins/start/<plugin-name>
git rm ./pack/plugins/start/<plugin-name>
rm -Rf .git/modules/pack/plugins/start/<plugin-name>
git commit
```

# How to Revert Changes to Plugins
```
git submodule deinit -f .
git submodule update --init
```
