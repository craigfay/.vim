Kant's original goals were unattainable. We have no direct intuition of the form of our minds. Peirce sought to renovate Kant's project. Though we can't have synthetic a-priori certainty about anything, he seeks ways to establish comparative confidence in our knowledge. This doesn't have the philosophical glamor of perfect apadectic certainty, but it's what's available to us, and better than falling into Hume's skeptical despair. Kant's dream was a-priori necessary and universal truth.
